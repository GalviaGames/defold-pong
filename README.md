# Pong game built with Defold

Tutorial series: https://bit.ly/3EvMZZX

This repo contains a step-by-step mini course to build a pong game using the game engine Defold. It has one branch per section, it might not necessarily translate exactly 1 to 1 to the videos though.

We'll keep the README updated as we go along.
